# Brig-Challenge


This project was a cool way to show how loops can be used in an array of users
The array was initially just the first object copied 6 times without any ids. So i added ids and used a for loop to iterate through the users. Then i used jquery to display them to the page. This was a one of the better projects to learn loops.
